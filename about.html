<!-- There isn't currently a link that connects to this page. From the content
that is present on this page there doesn't seem to be a good reason to have it
be a full html page. It would make more sense to only keep the content in the
body tags (like a template) and use ui.router to place it on the page. If the
concern was to not have the carosel, then you could do something with multipe
views - a named one for the carosel and then one without a name for the rest of
the content. Ui-router is super powerful and I encourage you guys to try doing
use some it's more complicated features in the future
